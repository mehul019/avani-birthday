  red: `My darling, my dear
The love of my life
I only want you to know

That when I am struggling
Or dealing with strife
To you is where I always go`,

  blue: `Your presence is calm
Like the ocean breeze
You steady my heart

When life grows loud
You bring me peace
My safe harbor always`,

  green: `Like spring you arrive
Soft, warm and bright
Filling me with hope

In your kindness
I find strength
In your love I grow`,

  yellow: `You are sunshine to me
Warmth I can hold
Brightness I can trust

You light my days
And heal my nights
My forever light`,

  orange: `You feel like sunset
Bold, unforgettable
A glow that stays

In your arms
The world softens
And everything feels right`,
